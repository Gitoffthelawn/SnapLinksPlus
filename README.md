## Need Help - Issue Tickets

I'm looking for some people to help triage [new issues](https://github.com/cpriest/SnapLinksPlus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and label them appropriately, answer them if they are feature related, confirm them if they are bugs.  It would be a **huge help** to the project.  I had time recently to work on the project and found myself spending time going through tickets instead.

If you're interested, please reach out to me by opening a ticket about it.

Thanks!
