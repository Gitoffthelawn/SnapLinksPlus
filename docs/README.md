# History

## Background on Snap Links 3

Snap Links Plus is being re-written from the ground up to be a [Web Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

This means some legacy features may no longer exist while other new features are written.

The reasons behind this are simple, [electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) is here, [XUL/XPCOM are on the way out and chrome style plugins are the new standard](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/), which also happens to be both restartless and compatible with chrome, opera and other browsers.

## Snap Links v2 Features

Snap Links Plus is a Firefox addon that lets you draw a lasso around links, checkboxes and other on-screen elements and open them in new tabs as  well as other actions:

* Open in New Tabs
* Open in New Windows
* Open Tabs in New Window6
* Bookmark All
* Download All
* Copy to Clipboard
